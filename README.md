This is practice project to generate a city in houdini procedurally using Python. Some of the important aspects ,where python is used, are loading building assets as well as setting attributes.

NOTE: At many places, VEX or node based approach will be a better and faster approach but the intention of the project was to learn to implement things in houdini using python.
